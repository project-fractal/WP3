This repository contains SELENE hardware platform instrumented with Register File Randomization (RFR) mechanism.
As explained in [1], RFR allows to:
- mitigate the impact of common-cause faults in the multicore CPUs (NOEL-V in this case), and 
- balance the usage of physical registers, and thus to extend the lifetime of the register file.
  
This component is included as a submodule from the SELENE repository:
https://gitlab.com/selene-riscv-platform/selene-hardware/-/tree/regfile_randomization.   
Remember to clone this repository recursively, as interconnect/axi and interconnect/common\_cells are submodules.

The directories are organized as follows:

grlib                               GRLIB IP core library
grlib/bin                           GRLIB infrastructure
grlib/boards                        Board description files
