# WP3T31-02 Interconnect to support Accelerators integration

The accelerators subsystem is interconnected to the memory by means of the AXI-pulp interconnect. To that end an AXI-lite crossbar and width converters are included the NOEL-V SoC interconnect using the appropriate VHDL to SystemVerilog wrappers. 


The component, and how to use it, is described in the README, and is available at the following LINK:
