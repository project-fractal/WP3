# WP3T32-06 Redundant Accelerator Scheme

The redundant acceleration scheme provides reliable/fail-safe HW acceleration of convolutional neural networks (CNN). 
This redundancy scheme includes N replicated accelerators, an HW/SW voter, 
and a control/monitoring process running on the NOELV CPU. 


The redundant acceleration scheme uses the SELENE hardware platform. 
The component, and how to use it, is described in the README, and is available at the following LINK:
