# WP3T35-02	Accelerator Adaptation to AI library

HLSinf is an FPGA-based accelerator specifically aimed to accelerate convolutional neural networks. HLSinf is designed around the channel slicing concept. The main operation performed by the accelerator is the 2D convolution operation.
HLSinf is efficiently supported by the LEDEL library.

 Using the FPGA computation target provided by the LEDEL we can offload computations to an FPGA device which in the case of the NOEL-V system used in FRACTAL is the same FPGA device that is used for the SoC prototype. 

The component, and how to use it, is described in the README, and is available at the following LINK:
